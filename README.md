# CryptoREACTion

This is a crypo app in React. I had done something similar in a combination of vamilla JS and JQuery for a group project in bootcamp. Wanted to do a new one in React. When building the bones of this, I followed a tutorial by Ania Kubow. 

Trying to add some features not in the tutorial. 

Fonts came from Google Fonts. Looked at Audiowide and Changa. Still building out the css. 

The favicon I added is something I downloaded from IconBolt.
